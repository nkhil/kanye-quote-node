## Description

The app uses the [https://kanye.rest/](https://kanye.rest/) API, and essentially serves up what it receives from the API. This was an exercise in test driven development using Cucumber and Chai. [This](https://medium.com/jigsaw-xyz/better-testing-with-cucumber-f01fb9ddc867) is a good post if you're unfamiliar with Cucumber/BDD and feature testing.
